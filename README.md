# Old McDonalds

Old McDonalds is a static website made by my group in my Senior High School years last 2017. I estimate that we made in a span of 1 month. This is unresponsive to multiple devices. I suggest resizing your browser to its max fit or desired fit.

## Installation

Download all folders and files.

```bash
https://github.com/ArviinM/Old-McDonalds.git
Open Home.html to start, and navigate on the website.
```
